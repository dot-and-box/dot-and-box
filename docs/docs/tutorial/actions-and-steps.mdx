# Actions and steps

Whenever you want to change any control property you need to take an action.
Actions are grouped into steps.

## Steps

Steps are defined by **title** and **duration**

Simple step could look like this:

```dabl tab showLineNumbers
box id: myBox size: [2,2]
step: 'this is my step title' duration: 2s
myBox -> (100,50)
```

```html tab showLineNumbers
<dot-and-box
  controls
  style="height: 250px"
  code="
box id: myBox size: [2,2]
step: 'this is my step title' duration: 2s
myBox -> (100,50)"
>
</dot-and-box>
```

Above step has title and takes 2 seconds to run. It consists of one action moving control **myBox** at position (100, 50)

## Sequential and parallel actions

Every step can have **sequential** and **parallel** actions or both

### sequential actions

To create two sequential actions in one step you need to declare them in new line
e.g below example first moves _myBox_ to point (50,-100), next _otherControl_ is moved by +(200,0)

:::note
absolute move **to** point **(x,y)** and relative move **by** point **+(x,y)** have same end effect here
:::

```dabl tab showLineNumbers
 step: 'sequential actions'
 myBox -> (50,-100)
 otherControl -> +(200,0)
```

```html tab showLineNumbers
<dot-and-box
  controls
  style="height: 250px"
  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
 box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
 step: 'sequential actions'
 myBox -> (50,-100)
 otherControl -> +(200,0)"
>
</dot-and-box>
```

<dot-and-box controls style={{height: 250}} code="
box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
step: 'sequential actions'
myBox -> (50,-100)
otherControl -> +(200,0)">
</dot-and-box>

### parallel actions

Here we we define one step with two actions done in parallel:
_myBox_ is moved to (50,-100) and _otherControl_ is moved by 200 units right at the same time

```dabl tab showLineNumbers
 step: 'parallel actions'
 myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
```

```html tab showLineNumbers
<dot-and-box
  controls
  style="height: 250px"
  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
 box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
 step: 'parallel actions'
 myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
"
>
</dot-and-box>
```

<dot-and-box controls style={{height: 250}} code="
box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
step: 'parallel actions'
myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
">
</dot-and-box>

### parallel and sequential actions

Now lets try to mix both in one step.

First _myBox_ is moved to (50,-100) and otherControl moved by +(200,0) at the same time and
finally otherControl and myBox swap positions

```dabl tab showLineNumbers
step: 'parallel and sequential actions'
myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
otherControl <-> myBox
```

```html tab showLineNumbers
<dot-and-box
  controls
  style="height: 250"
  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
 box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
 step: 'parallel and sequential actions'
 myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
 otherControl <-> myBox
"
>
</dot-and-box>
```

<dot-and-box controls style={{height: 250}} code="
box id: myBox at: [-3,-2] size: [2,1]
box id: otherControl at: [-3,0] size: [2,1]
step: 'parallel and sequential actions'
myBox -> (50,-100), otherControl -> +(200,0)
otherControl <-> myBox
">
</dot-and-box>
