# Units and location

## Units

Units are used to define control size and movement distance. \*_Dot and box_ supports two types of units:

- default units created with brackets

```dabl
(90,150)
```

:::info
default units _usually_ refer to screen pixels, however it's not a rule and it depends on canvas api implementation details
:::

- grid cell units created with square brackets

```dabl
[2,4]
```

which means: 2 times _cellSize_ (x axis) by 4 times _cellSize_ (y axis).

:::info
by default cell size is 50 units. It was created to make on screen calculations easier.
:::

so:
[2,4] is equal to (100,200)

## Location

Just like with the size, location can be expressed in two types of units: default and grid cells.

Controls are placed at point (0,0) on the dots-and-boxes surface area by default.
Which is more o less center of the _dot and box_ surface.

When using grid cells location [0,0] refers to right bottom side of point (0,0) marked as white dot at center below

<dot-and-box style={{height: 250}} controls experimental grid code="
boxes ids: '-2,-1' '-1,-1' '0,-1' '1,-1' '2,-1' at: [-2,-1]
boxes ids: '-2,0' '-1,0' '0,0' '1,0' '2,0' at: [-2,0]
dot text: '' at: 0, 0 radius: 5 color: white
