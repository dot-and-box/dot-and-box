# Units and location

## Units

Units are used to define control size and movement distance.
**Dot and box* supports two types of units:

- default units created with brackets

```dabl
(90,150)
```
:::info
default units *usually* refer to screen pixels, however it's not a rule and it depends on canvas api implementation details
:::

- grid cell units created with square brackets

```dabl
[2,4]
```
which means: 2 times *cellSize* (x axis) by 4 times *cellSize* (y axis).

:::info
by default cell size is 50 units. It was created to make on screen calculations easier.
:::

so:
[2,4] is equal to (100,200)


## Location

Just like with the size, location can be expressed in two types of units: default and grid cells.

Controls are placed at point (0,0) on the dots-and-boxes surface area by default.
Which is more o less center of the *dot and box* surface.

When using grid cells location [0,0] refers to right bottom side of point (0,0) marked as white dot at center below

<dot-and-box style={{height: 250}} controls experimental grid code="
    boxes ids: '-2,-1' '-1,-1' '0,-1' '1,-1' '2,-1' at: [-2,-1]
    boxes ids: '-2,0' '-1,0' '0,0' '1,0' '2,0' at: [-2,0]
    dot text: '' at: 0, 0 size: 5 color: white
    dot id: black text: '[-4,-2]' color: black at: [-4, -2] fontSize: 8

    step: 'move black do to [0,0]'
    black <- '[0,0]', black -> [0,0]
    ">
</dot-and-box>
